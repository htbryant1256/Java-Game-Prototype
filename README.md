Scope refers to the visibility of variables. depending on where a variable is made, it can be
 * seen in only a single method, or in an entire class. a single method has a small scope, but if a
 * variable can be seen by the entire class it has a large scope.
 * 
 * A variable in computer programming is something that you plan on changing a lot, instead of a
 * piece of data a variable can be used instead. Making that data very easy to change without
 * messing up the rest of the code.
 * 
 * The "==" operator does not work with strings because it compares the instances of two objects not
 * the true value of them. That is why .equals is used instead, this command compares the values in
 * the string instead of the instances.
 * 
 * operator precedence has to do with how java reads operators in order. Different operators have
 * different precedence levels. a good way to think of this is PEMDAS.
Inheritance is when data from a larger parent class can be used
 * in smaller child classes. Parent classes can't use new data created
 * in a child class because of this inheritance.
 * This is very useful because code can be written in the parent class
 * and be used by all child classes below it. Making it very easy for
 * the child classes to all access the same thing.
 * 
 Polymorphism is when you have multiple child classes 
 * that all inherit code from a parent class.
 * If one of the child classes only uses some of the parent code
 * and then the rest is a unique code apart from the other child classes
 * then this is polymorphism
 
 
 I overloaded the method UserInfo in class UserInfo.
 
 I used one dimensional arrays in the Item class to store weapon drops.
 
 I made an array example mini game to show off most of the array commands. I had a hard time finding a spot for it in my shop method.
 
 I used the enhanced for loop in my array minigame to add a sum of the int array.
 
 I used an exception for the shop when handiling the int inputs for the item choices.
