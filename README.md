/*Henry Bryant
I wanted to make a side scrolling game but I 
didn't know enough yet to do so, so I used the 
text scrolling upward as a way to advance the stage.

The Game is still very basic, no matter what you win.
I plan on continuing the game.

(Add a list and description of Java built-in data types within the user interface or in comments)
byte: Stores very small numbers
char: Stores a single character
short: Stores from around -33,000 to 33,000 
int: Stores whole numbers
long: Stores large whole numbers
float: Stores decimal numbers up to 7 digits
double: Stores decimal numbers up to 15 digits
boolean: Stores True or False

(Define (in English) the term "variable" as it relates to computer programming in a comment or the user interface)
variable: a placeholder to store data.

(Define (in English) the term "scope" as it relates to computer programming in a comment or the user interface)
scope: acessability of a variable, depends on where 
the variable was declared*/

(Use final with a variable and describe what it means in a comment)
final int health = 20;
/*health is a final variable because I am still 
working on the game and don't need that variable to change.*/

(Use a boolean variable with an appropriate name  (singular noun, lowerCamelCase))
boolean start1 = true;
		while(start1 == true) {
   //boolean variable
   
(Use an double variable with an appropriate name (singular noun, lowerCamelCase))   
  double enemyHealth = 5;
//double variable
