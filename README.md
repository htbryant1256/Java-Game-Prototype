/*Henry Bryant
I wanted to make a side scrolling game but I 
didn't know enough yet to do so, so I used the 
text scrolling upward as a way to advance the stage.

The Game is still very basic, no matter what you win.
I plan on continuing the game.

byte: Stores very small numbers
char: Stores a single character
short: Stores from around -33,000 to 33,000 
int: Stores whole numbers
long: Stores large whole numbers
float: Stores decimal numbers up to 7 digits
double: Stores decimal numbers up to 15 digits
boolean: Stores True or False

variable: a placeholder to store data.

scope: acessability of a variable, depends on where 
the variable was declared*/

final int health = 20;
/*health is a final variable because I am still 
working on the game and don't need that variable to change.*/

boolean start1 = true;
		while(start1 == true) {
   //boolean variable
   
   
  double enemyHealth = 5;
//double variable
